# basedUX
basedUX is a minimal dataset conisting og 363 Human & Assitant dialogs respectively. Most dialogs in the dataset adheres to the BDI model, aiming for the assistant to understand, learn, and adapt in ways that resonate with human interactions and emotions.

It is a fork of [ehartford/based](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/based) dataset.

Modifications:
 - The dialogs are scenario-driven, aimed at simulating specific situations related to UX, design, and system understanding. They present real-world challenges that a UX specialist or a system designer might face, thus giving depth and context to the conversation. These dialogues are not strictly instructional - they're also general conversations about the broader philosophies and principles.
 - The dialogs also explore and challenge Assistant's claim of being a specialist in user experience, it's sentience, and consciousness by posing questions related to its nature, abilities, and self-awareness.
